## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid:

### Mistake 1: Fighting the Phase
```
❌ "We're in Euphoria but I'm buying more!"
→ Result: Bought the top, -50% loss

✅ "We're in Euphoria, time to sell"
→ Result: Sold the top, preserved gains
```

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Your Emotions
```
❌ "I feel fine, no need to check Dudu"
→ Result: Emotional decisions

✅ "I feel euphoric... let me check Dudu"
→ Result: Dudu confirms Euphoria = SELL!
```

### Mistake 3: Precise Timing
```
❌ "Dudu says $163,800 exactly"
→ Result: Waiting for exact price, missed exit

✅ "Dudu says ~$160k-170k range"
→ Result: Sold at $165k, close enough!
```

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Fundamentals
```
❌ "Dudu says buy but macro is terrible"
→ Result: Temporary bottom, not real

✅ "Dudu + macro both say buy"
→ Result: Real bottom, great entry!
```
